## 🎮 Testing Your Build

After configuration, test in game:

1. [ ] Shouts are casting automatically on cooldown
2. [ ] Bash is being used to generate fury
3. [ ] Hammer of the Ancients casts after 2 Bash stacks
4. [ ] Steel Grasp pulls enemies together
5. [ ] Charge works for mobility
6. [ ] No other damage skills are interfering

## 🔧 Fine-Tuning

If something isn't working:

### HOTA Not Casting?
- Check "Enable Spell" is ON
- Verify "Only Bash Buffed" is enabled
- Make sure you have 2 Bash stacks (watch console messages)
- Check fury level (need 35+ fury)

### Too Much/Too Little Bash?
- Bash automatically fills in as needed
- If using too much, you might have other skills enabled that shouldn't be

### Skills Casting at Wrong Times?
- Verify min enemies settings
- Check filter modes on shouts
- Ensure orbwalker mode is active (press your orb key)

### Not Enough Mobility?
- Enable Leap if you prefer it over Charge
- Adjust charge/leap targeting

## 📊 Expected Rotation Pattern

You should see this pattern:
```
1. War Cry (buff)
2. Steel Grasp (if 3+ enemies)
3. Bash → Bash (2 stacks)
4. Hammer of the Ancients (buffed damage!)
5. Repeat steps 3-4
```

During tough fights:
```
1. All Shouts active
2. Wrath of the Berserk
3. Call of the Ancients  
4. Steel Grasp
5. Bash x2 → HOTA spam
```

## ✨ Pro Tips

- ✓ Console messages tell you what's casting
- ✓ "BASH PASSIVE READY ABOUT TO SLAMDUNK!!" means you have 2 stacks
- ✓ Keep War Cry active (check buff bar)
- ✓ Steel Grasp before HOTA = more damage
- ✓ Save Wrath for elite packs
- ✓ Charge to reposition, not for damage
